It is the first time I opened my block page since 01/28/2024. Almost a whole year has been past and there are lots of things happened as well.
From all of them the most overwhelming thing is long Covid. Long story in short, I was narrowly escaped from dying on bed. Now I am trying to getting
back to where I was, and hopefully pick up what I have left soon. 
What a life! But it happend.
